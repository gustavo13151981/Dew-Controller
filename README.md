## Theory of operation
The dew controller continuously calculates the required heating power for each connected dew heater strap based upon lens diameter and current temperature and humidity conditions. By carefully controlling the heating power negative seeing effects caused by undesired air movements are reduced to a minimum.
The underlying algorithm compensates for the rate of heat flow from the telescope lens to the cold sky, assuming that the telescope is equipped with a dew shield and only the circular area of the lens is exposed to the sky. An adjustable 'fudge factor' copes with all other deficiencies, like lack of thermal insulation from the heater straps. The theory gives very simular results to the rule of thumb given by [1].

## Hardware
### Controller Unit
The dew controller is build around a PIC16F15356 microcontroller with 16k words of flash memory and 2kB of RAM. It is configured to run at a clock frequency of 4.0 MHz, generated by its internal oscillator. With hindsight, regarding flash memory size and all the text constants required by the menu system, the part wasn't the optimal choice. Without compiler optimizations the code doesn't fit on the device. For the next revision of the hardware a pin compatible PIC18F should be considered.

Since the controller has to be capable of measuring the current on each heater channel, the circuit comprises a TI INA180 high side current sense amplifier. To reduce cost and complexity, only a single amplifier is used and firmware measures the current of each channel sequentially. As for overcurrent and short circuit protection, an integrated solution is used. The Vishay SiP32419 is a load switch with programmable current limit up to 3.5A and eliminates the need for a regular fuse (for which you never bring any spares, when you operate the device on a field trip).

The input voltage is measured with a simple voltage divider, buffered by 1/2 LM358. The other half of the Opamp is used for buffering the auxiliary temperature sensor input.
